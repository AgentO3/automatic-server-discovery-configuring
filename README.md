automatic-server-discovery-configuring
======================================

When a new server is brought online in a cluster it's it first task should be to determine what it's role in that cluster should be. This process should be woven into the DNA of that server. Once it determines what role is required by the cluster it will automatically provision it's self with the tools it need to become a webserver, database, etc.
